/// A normalized point in a view's coordinate space.
///
/// Use a unit point to represent a location in a view without having to know
/// the view's rendered size. The point stores a value in each dimension that
/// indicates the fraction of the view's size in that dimension --- measured
/// from the view's origin --- where the point appears. For example, you can
/// create a unit point that represents the center of any view by using the
/// value `0.5` for each dimension:
///
///     let unitPoint = UnitPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5)
///
/// To project the unit point into the rendered view's coordinate space,
/// multiply each component of the unit point with the corresponding
/// component of the view's size:
///
///     let projectedPoint = CGPoint(
///         x: unitPoint.x * size.width,
///         y: unitPoint.y * size.height
///     )
///
/// You can perform this calculation yourself if you happen to know a view's
/// size, but DanceUI typically does this for you to carry out operations that
/// you request, like when you:
///
/// * Transform a shape using a shape modifier. For example, to rotate a
///   shape with ``Shape/rotation(_:anchor:)``, you indicate a unit point
///   that you want to rotate the shape around.
/// * Override the alignment of the view in a `Grid` cell using the
///   ``View/gridCellAnchor(_:)`` view modifier. The grid aligns the projection
///   of a unit point onto the view with the projection of the same unit point
///   onto the cell.
/// * Create a gradient that has a center, or start and stop points, relative
///   to the shape that you are styling. See the gradient methods in
///   ``ShapeStyle``.
///
/// You can create custom unit points with explicit values, like the example
/// above, or you can use one of the built-in unit points that DanceUI provides,
/// like ``UnitPoint/zero``, ``UnitPoint/center``, or ``UnitPoint/topTrailing``.
/// The built-in values correspond to the alignment
/// positions of the similarly named, built-in ``Alignment`` types.
///
/// > Note: A unit point with one or more components outside the range `[0, 1]`
/// projects to a point outside of the view.
///
/// ### Layout direction
///
/// When a user configures their device to use a left-to-right language like
/// English, the system places the view's origin in its top-left corner,
/// with positive x toward the right and positive y toward the bottom of the
/// view. In a right-to-left environment, the origin moves to the upper-right
/// corner, and the positive x direction changes to be toward the left. You
/// don't typically need to do anything to handle this change, because DanceUI
/// applies the change to all aspects of the system. For example, see the
/// discussion about layout direction in ``HorizontalAlignment``.
///
/// It's important to test your app for the different locales that you
/// distribute your app in. For more information about the localization process,
/// see [localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/localization).
