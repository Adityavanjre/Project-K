    /// Layers the views that you specify behind this view.
    ///
    /// Use this modifier to place one or more views behind another view.
    /// For example, you can place a collection of stars beind a ``Text`` view:
    ///
    ///     Text("ABCDEF")
    ///         .background(alignment: .leading) { Star(color: .red) }
    ///         .background(alignment: .center) { Star(color: .green) }
    ///         .background(alignment: .trailing) { Star(color: .blue) }
    ///
    /// The example above assumes that you've defined a `Star` view with a
    /// parameterized color:
    ///
    ///     struct Star: View {
    ///         var color: Color
    ///
    ///         var body: some View {
    ///             Image(systemName: "star.fill")
    ///                 .foregroundStyle(color)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// By setting different `alignment` values for each modifier, you make the
    /// stars appear in different places behind the text:
    ///
    ///
    /// If you specify more than one view in the `content` closure, the modifier
    /// collects all of the views in the closure into an implicit ``ZStack``,
    /// taking them in order from back to front. For example, you can layer a
    /// vertical bar behind a circle, with both of those behind a horizontal
    /// bar:
    ///
    ///     Color.blue
    ///         .frame(width: 200, height: 10) // Creates a horizontal bar.
    ///         .background {
    ///             Color.green
    ///                 .frame(width: 10, height: 100) // Creates a vertical bar.
    ///             Circle()
    ///                 .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
    ///         }
    ///
    /// Both the background modifier and the implicit ``ZStack`` composed from
    /// the background content --- the circle and the vertical bar --- use a
    /// default ``Alignment/center`` alignment. The vertical bar appears
    /// centered behind the circle, and both appear as a composite view centered
    /// behind the horizontal bar:
    ///
    ///
    /// If you specify an alignment for the background, it applies to the
    /// implicit stack rather than to the individual views in the closure. You
    /// can see this if you add the ``Alignment/leading`` alignment:
    ///
    ///     Color.blue
    ///         .frame(width: 200, height: 10)
    ///         .background(alignment: .leading) {
    ///             Color.green
    ///                 .frame(width: 10, height: 100)
    ///             Circle()
    ///                 .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
    ///         }
    ///
    /// The vertical bar and the circle move as a unit to align the stack
    /// with the leading edge of the horizontal bar, while the
    /// vertical bar remains centered on the circle:
    ///
    ///
    /// To control the placement of individual items inside the `content`
    /// closure, either use a different background modifier for each item, as
    /// the earlier example of stars under text demonstrates, or add an explicit
    /// ``ZStack`` inside the content closure with its own alignment:
    ///
    ///     Color.blue
    ///         .frame(width: 200, height: 10)
    ///         .background(alignment: .leading) {
    ///             ZStack(alignment: .leading) {
    ///                 Color.green
    ///                     .frame(width: 10, height: 100)
    ///                 Circle()
    ///                     .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///
    /// The stack alignment ensures that the circle's leading edge aligns with
    /// the vertical bar's, while the background modifier aligns the composite
    /// view with the horizontal bar:
    ///
    ///
    /// You can achieve layering without a background modifier by putting both
    /// the modified view and the background content into a ``ZStack``. This
    /// produces a simpler view hierarchy, but it changes the layout priority
    /// that DanceUI applies to the views. Use the background modifier when you
    /// want the modified view to dominate the layout.
    ///
    /// If you want to specify a ``ShapeStyle`` like a
    /// ``HierarchicalShapeStyle`` or a ``Material`` as the background, use
    /// ``View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:)`` instead.
    /// To specify a ``Shape`` or ``InsettableShape``, use
    /// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-89n7j`` or
    /// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-20tq5``, respectively.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - alignment: The alignment that the modifier uses to position the
    ///     implicit ``ZStack`` that groups the background views. The default
    ///     is ``Alignment/center``.
    ///   - content: A ``ViewBuilder`` that you use to declare the views to draw
    ///     behind this view, stacked in a cascading order from bottom to top.
    ///     The last view that you list appears at the front of the stack.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view that uses the specified content as a background.
